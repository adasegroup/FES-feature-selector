# FES-feature-selector

## Overview

This repository implements a framework for evaluating different feature selection methods. We provide a baseline permutation importance [2] method in our pipeline (using implementation from sklearn) as well as implementations of two more recent methods:  Normalised Iterative Hard Thresholding [1] and Simultaneous Feature and Feature Group Selection through Hard Thresholding [3]. The pipeline allows to perform evaluation on both synthetic and real data.
